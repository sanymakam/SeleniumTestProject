To identify elements on a webpage using Java and Selenium WebDriver, you need to use locators which are used to find an element in the DOM (Document Object Model). These locators can be CSS Selectors, XPaths or ID/Class Name. 

Given that there isn't any information about how the elements should be located we have assumed a common practice where the element is identified by its class name. If this was not the case you would need more information to identify it correctly. 

The WebElements for locating these elements in Java code can look something like:
```java
@FindBy(className = "product-title")
private WebElement productTitle;

@FindBy(className = "price")
private WebElement price;
```
In the above snippet, we are assuming that the name of class for the product title is 'product-title' and price is represented by a class named 'price'. 

The complete code would be:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>.seleni
