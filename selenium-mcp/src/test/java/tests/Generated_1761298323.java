To find an element by analyzing the page source and image cues, you'll need to use a combination of XPath and CSS selectors to locate the correct elements. However, identifying these locators is often more challenging as it requires inspecting the webpage's source code or using browser developer tools.

Assuming that we have an element identified by "sampleInput", here are some possible locators:

1) XPath: //*[@id="product_list"]/div[2]/div[contains(@class, 'item-box')]/h3/a[text()='Laptop']
This XPath would select the H3 tag containing a link to "Laptop". The location and class of this element might be different based on the website's structure.

2) CSS Selector: #product_list > div.item-box h3 a[href*="laptop"] 
Similar to above, but using a CSS selector instead of XPath. This one would also select H3 tags containing links that include "laptop". Again, it's possible the class names or other attributes on these elements may differ based on how they are structured in the webpage source code.

Once you identify the correct locators, you can use them to define your WebElement in Java:

```java
@FindBy(xpath = "//*[@id='product_list']/div[2]/div[contains(@class, 'item-box')]/h3/a[text()='Laptop']")
private WebElement laptop;
```
Or with CSS Selector:

```java
@FindBy(cssSelector = "#product<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>_list > div.item-box h3 a[href*=\"laptops\"]")
private WebElement laptop;
```
Remember to replace the placeholder "s" in cssSelector with your actual class name that contains information about laptops on the webpage. 

After defining this element, you would use it in your page object as shown:

```java
public void clickLaptop() {
    laptop.click();
}
```
The above method will simulate a click event on the identified WebElement (i.e., clicking the link to "laptop"). Be sure to replace `s` with the actual class name you're using for laptops on your webpage. 

Please note that these are just examples and might not work directly without further adjustments based on the specific structure of your page source code or any changes made by site owners in their website design. The aim is to locate an element that can be interacted with via a WebDriver instance, for example clicking a link leading to products' details.
