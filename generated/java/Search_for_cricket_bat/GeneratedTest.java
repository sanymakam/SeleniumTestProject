Based on the provided information and context, here is a simple example of how you can use Page Object Model with Selenium in Java. The task to search for "cricket bat" would be slightly different based on the website structure but this provides a general approach.

Firstly, create separate classes for each page:

```java
public class HomePage {
    @FindBy(css = ".Pke_EE") 
    private WebElement searchInput;
    
    public HomePage(WebDriver driver) {
        PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
    }
  
    public void enterSearchItem(String itemName){
        searchInput.sendKeys(itemName);
    }
}
```

Then you can create a test class and use it:

```java
public class FlipkartTest {
  private WebDriver driver;
  
  @BeforeMethod
  public void setUp() {
      // Initialize the driver (ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver etc)
      driver = new ChromeDriver();
      // Navigate to the URL
      driver.get("https://www.flipkart.com/");
      
      HomePage homePage = new HomePage(driver);
      homePage.enterSearchItem("cricket bat");
  }
  
  @AfterMethod
  public void tearDown() {
      // Close the browser window
      driver.quit();
  }
}
```

This code snippet will navigate to Flipkart's homepage, find the search input field and enter "cricket bat" in it. You can continue with additional actions like clicking on the search button or performing other actions based on your test requirements.
